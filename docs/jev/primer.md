# Introduction

> Jev is TypeSafe's flagship model and the first System One model. Send state and typed questions; get structured answers your code can use directly.

Large language models (LLMs) are designed to produce text for humans to read. When you need a model to make a judgment that your code will consume, that creates a mismatch: you are coercing a text-generation system into outputting structured decisions, then parsing the results back into something your code can depend on.

Jev is TypeSafe's flagship model and the first [System One model](/concepts/system-one). System One models are built to make fast, structured decisions that software can use directly. Jev evaluates typed *questions* against a *state* and returns structured results directly. No text generation, no parsing. You get typed values and probability distributions that your code can branch on, sort by, and route with.

## TypeSafe primitives

TypeSafe exposes three *AI primitives*. Similar to software primitives, our AI primitives are modular, composable, structured, reliable, and fast. Each asks a different type of *question* and returns a different type of answer.

| Question type                | Goal                         | Returns                                 |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [Choice](/primitives/choice) | Choose an option from a list | `choice`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |
| [Score](/primitives/score)   | Score the state on a rubric  | `score`, `probabilities`, `confidence`  |
| [Noul](/primitives/noul)     | Is this statement true?      | `noul` (0–1)                            |

All three *question* types can be mixed in a single API call. Every *question* is evaluated in parallel and in isolation against the same *state* in one go. Adding questions barely changes the response time. Each question is evaluated independently, so adding more questions does not create context-rot.

## Atomic questions, composed in code

System One models work best when each question asks one specific, well-scoped thing. Think of each question as a gut-check determination: the kind of judgment a highly knowledgeable person could make in a few seconds given the right context.

If the question you want to ask would require extended reasoning or weighs multiple independent factors, decompose it. Ask each factor as a separate question, then combine the results with logic in your code. This keeps each individual evaluation reliable and gives you full control over how dimensions are weighted.

For example, instead of "rate this startup pitch," ask separately about market size, technical feasibility, and differentiation. Combine the scores with your own formula. When priorities shift, change a coefficient in your code rather than rewriting a prompt.

# Quick start

> Prefer to just dive in? Here's everything you need to get started immediately.

## Try it: the Playground

1. **Open the [Playground](https://console.typesafe.ai/playground)** and log in.
2. **Paste any text** as the state.

```plaintext title="Sample state" theme={null}
Hi, I've been trying to connect my Stripe account for 3 days and it keeps failing. I'm losing sales. Please help ASAP.
```

3. **Add a question.** Try a Noul question: `"Does this message express urgency?"`

```json theme={null}
{
  "urgency": {
    "type": "noul",
    "instructions": "Does this message express urgency?"
  }
}
```

4. **Add more questions.** Mix Noul, Choice, and Score in one call and see all results at once.

## Call it: the API

1. **Get your API key** from the [dashboard](https://console.typesafe.ai/keys)

See the [API Reference](/api) for all the details.

## Code it: the Python SDK

1. **Install the SDK** (requires Python >= 3.10).

```bash title="With pip" theme={null}
pip install typesafe-sdk
```

```bash title="With uv" theme={null}
uv add typesafe-sdk
```

2. **Use the SDK.** The client reads `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` from the environment and calls `jev-latest` by default.

```python theme={null}
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, Score, TypeSafeClient

client = TypeSafeClient()

ticket = "Hi, I've been trying to connect my Stripe account for 3 days and it keeps failing. I'm losing sales. Please help ASAP."

response = client.system_one(
    state=ticket,
    questions={
        "department": Choice(
            instructions="Which team should handle this",
            criteria={
                "billing": "Payment or subscription issues",
                "technical": "Bugs or integration problems",
                "sales": "Pricing or account questions",
            },
        ),
        "frustration": Score(
            instructions="How frustrated the customer appears",
            criteria=[
                "Calm, just stating facts",
                "Frustrated but civil",
                "Very angry, strong language",
            ],
        ),
        "is_urgent": Noul(
            instructions="The message conveys urgency or time-sensitivity",
        ),
    },
)

print(response.answers["department"].choice)  # "billing"
print(response.answers["frustration"].score)  # 1.035
print(response.answers["is_urgent"].noul)     # 0.999
```

See [client SDKs](/sdk) for installation options and detailed usage.

## Vibe it: the agent skill

1. **[Install the TypeSafe skill](/agent-skill#installation)** using the Claude Code plugin or `npx skills add typesafe-ai/skills --skill typesafe-ai`. You can also [read SKILL.md on GitHub](https://github.com/typesafe-ai/skills/blob/main/skills/typesafe-ai/SKILL.md).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    Run these two commands in your terminal:

    ```bash theme={null} theme={null} theme={null} theme={null}
    claude plugin marketplace add typesafe-ai/skills
    claude plugin install typesafe@typesafe-ai
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Other agents">
    ```bash theme={null} theme={null} theme={null} theme={null}
    npx skills add typesafe-ai/skills --skill typesafe-ai
    ```

    Choose your agent when prompted. Installation is project-local by default; add `-g` to install globally.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Copy to your agent">
    Paste this prompt into your coding agent:

    ```text wrap theme={null} theme={null} theme={null} theme={null}
    Install the TypeSafe skill. If you're in Claude Code, run `claude plugin marketplace add typesafe-ai/skills`, then `claude plugin install typesafe@typesafe-ai`. If you're in another agent, run `npx skills add typesafe-ai/skills --skill typesafe-ai` and select your agent. Use one installation method. You can read the skill directly at https://github.com/typesafe-ai/skills/blob/main/skills/typesafe-ai/SKILL.md (raw: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/typesafe-ai/skills/main/skills/typesafe-ai/SKILL.md). Then use the TypeSafe skill when working on this project.
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

2. **Tell your coding agent** to use the TypeSafe skill as you build!

```plaintext title="Coding agent prompt" theme={null}
Let's build a simple CLI that uses the TypeSafe API to evaluate a set of supplied documents on multiple dimensions. Use the TypeSafe skill to understand how to use the TypeSafe API and how to structure the system. Ask me questions about what kinds of documents I want to evaluate and on what dimensions.
```

See the [Agent Skill](/agent-skill) page for more details.

# System One

> System One models make fast, structured decisions for software. Jev is TypeSafe's flagship model and the first System One model.

System One models are a class of AI models built to make fast, structured decisions that software can use directly. A System One model evaluates a [state](/concepts/state) and returns typed answers and probabilities.

Jev is TypeSafe's flagship model and the first System One model.

Like an LLM, a System One model understands natural-language input. It returns typed decisions and probabilities rather than generated text.

<Note>
  Jev currently accepts text input only. It evaluates strings, JSON objects, and arrays of text. Images, audio, and video are not supported (yet).
</Note>

## How it differs from an LLM

System One models are trained for calibrated decisions: their probabilities are optimized against outcomes to reflect uncertainty. Calibration is measured across groups of predictions; it does not guarantee that an individual answer is correct.

System One models do not write replies, produce code, or generate explanations of their reasoning. You define the possible answers through [primitives](/primitives):

| Primitive                    | Question                              | Example answer space                          | Example output      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| [Choice](/primitives/choice) | Which team should handle this ticket? | `billing`, `technical`, or `account`          | `choice: "billing"` |
| [Score](/primitives/score)   | How frustrated is this customer?      | 0 = calm, 1 = frustrated, 2 = very frustrated | `score: 1.4`        |
| [Noul](/primitives/noul)     | Does this message request a refund?   | True or false                                 | `noul: 0.95`        |

These are illustrative configurations and values. The primitive pages describe the available configuration options and full response fields.

Read the [AI primer](/introduction/machine-learning-primer) to learn how System One models work and how they are trained.

<Note>
  The System One name comes from the concept Daniel Kahneman popularized in his book *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. System 1 thinking is fast and intuitive. System 2 is slower and more deliberate. Here, the emphasis is on fast, focused judgments.
</Note>

## Fast judgments inside a larger workflow

For a refund request, your application can:

1. Build a state containing the customer's message, the relevant transactions, and the refund policy.
2. Ask independent questions together: whether a refund was requested, whether the evidence indicates a duplicate charge, and whether the policy supports a refund.
3. Combine the answers with deterministic checks in code, then route the case for action or review.

Once you have seen the primitives in action, you can combine them into a larger system. Because System One models return typed, constrained outputs rather than free-form text, your code can inspect and combine its answers into predictable workflows. See [How to build with TypeSafe](/concepts/how-to-build-with-system-one) for the full workflow.

Answers from System One models also include [confidence](/confidence), so you can decide when to act and when to escalate to a person or a reasoning model.

## Call a System One model

Call a System One model through one of our [client SDKs](/sdk) or `POST /v1/systemone` in the [HTTP API](/api). The `model` field selects which model handles the request. The examples in these docs use `jev-latest`, which is also the SDK default. See [Models](/models) for the available models, their prices, and their aliases.

Start with [State](/concepts/state) to prepare the input and [Primitives (Questions)](/primitives) to explore the types of questions you can ask.

# State

> What state is, how to structure it, and how to give a System One model the context it needs.

**State** is the content you ask a System One model to evaluate. It could be a support message, a passage of text, or the current state of your application. You pass it in the `state` field of an API request, alongside the questions you want answered.

Each request evaluates one state against one or more questions. All questions see the same state and are evaluated independently. You can mix [Choice](/primitives/choice), [Score](/primitives/score), and [Noul](/primitives/noul) questions in one request.

## State can be as simple as a string

The simplest state is a plain string:

```python theme={null}
state = "My card was charged twice."
```

State can also be a JSON object or array containing related context, examples, and other information that helps the model answer the associated questions. Think of state as the material you would present to a panel of experts before asking them to make a judgment. In Python, pass the corresponding string, dictionary, or list directly to `client.system_one(state=...)`.

| Format | Useful for                                          | Example                                                                 |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| String | A message, article, or passage                      | `"My card was charged twice."`                                          |
| Object | Named fields, related records, or application state | `{"message": "My card was charged twice.", "order_id": "A-104"}`        |
| Array  | A sequence of messages or records                   | `["Hi", "My customer number is TS1337.", "My card was charged twice."]` |

Use an object for most requests so each part of the state has a descriptive name and its relationships remain clear. A string is suitable when the use case is simple and requires only one piece of text.

<Note>
  Jev accepts text only. State must be a string, JSON object, or array of text values. Images, audio, and video are not supported (yet). Jev's primary training language is English; other languages, including CJK scripts, are accepted but currently have lower accuracy — see [Models](/models#language-support).
</Note>

```json title="A support conversation as state" theme={null}
{
  "ticket": {
    "subject": "Duplicate charge",
    "messages": [
      {"from": "customer", "text": "I was charged twice for order A-104. Please refund the duplicate."},
      {"from": "support", "text": "We are checking the charges."}
    ]
  },
  "order": {
    "id": "A-104",
    "charges": [
      {"amount_usd": 49, "status": "captured"},
      {"amount_usd": 49, "status": "captured"}
    ]
  },
  "refund_policy": "Duplicate charges are eligible for a refund."
}
```

This object is one state, even though it contains a conversation, an order, and a policy. Put related information together when the decision requires comparing those parts.

## Separate content from questions

The state contains the content and supporting facts. [Questions](/primitives) define the judgments the model should make about that material. For example, keep the refund request and policy in the state, then ask whether the customer requested a refund and whether the policy supports it.

See [Primitives (Questions)](/primitives) for guidance on instructions, criteria, question types, and asking several questions about one state.

See the [API reference](/api) for the request schema and [client SDKs](/sdk) for installation, typed inputs, and response handling.

TypeSafe's primitives are the small, typed building blocks you compose in code. They come in pairs: a question defines one judgment for a [System One model](/concepts/system-one) to make about a [state](/concepts/state), and its answer is the typed value that comes back. You compose the answers in your code to make decisions. There are three question types, each returning a different shape of answer.

| Type                         | What it answers         | Returns                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [Choice](/primitives/choice) | Which of these options? | `choice`, `probabilities`, `confidence`          |
| [Score](/primitives/score)   | Which level?            | `score`, `legend`, `probabilities`, `confidence` |
| [Noul](/primitives/noul)     | Is this true?           | `noul` (0 to 1)                                  |

You can ask one question or send several together. Every question in a request sees the same state, is evaluated independently, and returns a typed answer under the ID you chose.

## Ask for one snap judgment per question

System One models are built for fast, focused judgments. Ask for a judgment a knowledgeable person makes in a second given the right context. "Does this message convey urgency?" is a good question. "Analyze this message and determine the best course of action" is not. That needs slow reasoning, and it is a signal to break the task into small questions and compose the answers in code.

If the judgment you want depends on several independent factors, ask about each factor separately and combine the answers with your own logic. Instead of "rate this startup pitch", ask about market size, technical feasibility, and differentiation, then weight them in code based on their relative importance. When priorities shift, change the value of weights rather than rewriting a prompt. [Ask multiple questions together](#ask-multiple-questions-together) shows how to do this.

## Define a question

Every question has an ID, a `type`, and `instructions`. Choice and Score questions also take `criteria`, which define the options for a Choice question or the levels for a Score. Noul questions accept `criteria` as an optional clarification of what yes and no mean.

* ID. The key you pick, such as `refund_requested`. It identifies the answer in the response.
* `type`. One of `choice`, `score`, or `noul`.
* `instructions`. The question you are asking about the state. This is where your evaluation logic goes. Write it as a clear, specific question, or as a statement for the model to judge.
* `criteria`. The possible answers: a map of options for a Choice question, an ordered list of levels for a Score, and an optional description of yes and no for a Noul. Each question type's page covers its shape.

This question asks whether a customer requested a refund:

```python theme={null}
from typesafe_sdk import Noul

questions = {
    "refund_requested": Noul(
        instructions="Does the customer request a refund?",
    ),
}
```

<Tip>
  Question IDs are for your code. They are not sent to the model. Write the complete question in `instructions`, even when the ID seems self-explanatory.
</Tip>

## Choose a question type

Pick the type that matches the shape of the answer you need.

* **Choice** fits when the answer is one of a known set of options with no order between them: routing a ticket to a department, classifying a document type, detecting a programming language. Give the full list of options, and add an `other` or `none of the above` option when the list might not cover every input.

* **Score** fits when the answer falls on a spectrum and you can describe what each point on that spectrum means: bug severity, customer frustration, skill level. The levels are yours to define, and the model returns a position along them.

* **Noul** fits a clean yes/no question where the probability itself is the useful signal: does this message report a bug, is the customer requesting a refund, does the resume mention distributed systems.

<Note>
  Use Noul for a yes/no judgment and Score to measure a position on a spectrum. "Is this candidate strong in Python?" needs a clear definition of "strong". A Noul value of 0.5 means the model gives yes and no equal probability. It does not mean the candidate has a medium skill level. An unclear definition makes that probability hard to interpret.

  If you want to measure skill level, use a Score with defined levels, such as no experience, some familiarity, daily use, and deep expertise. If you need a yes/no decision, define the condition clearly, such as "Does the resume state that the candidate has used Python at work?"
</Note>

If two types both seem to fit, prefer the one whose answer your code can act on directly. A Choice between `refund`, `rebook`, and `information` maps straight onto three code paths. A Score of customer frustration maps onto a threshold. A Noul maps onto an `if`.

## What comes back

Answers are primitives too. Each question type returns a typed value that your code can compare, threshold, sort, pass into further logic, or put into the state of a follow-up request (see [When one question depends on another](#when-one-question-depends-on-another)).

| Type   | Answer fields                                    | How to read it                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Choice | `choice`, `probabilities`, `confidence`          | `choice` is the selected option. `probabilities` is the distribution across every option. `confidence` summarizes how peaked that distribution is.                   |
| Score  | `score`, `legend`, `probabilities`, `confidence` | `score` is a position along your levels, and can fall between two of them. `legend` repeats the levels by number. `probabilities` is the distribution across levels. |
| Noul   | `noul`                                           | The probability that the answer is yes. Near 1 is a strong yes, near 0 a strong no, near 0.5 uncertain. Noul has no separate `confidence`.                           |

Two properties of these answers make them composable:

* **Every answer is constrained to the options you supplied.** The model returns a probability distribution over your options or levels, never a value outside them. Your code never has to recover a value from generated prose.
* **Every answer is independent.** One question's answer is not hidden context for another. You can add or remove questions without changing the others' results.

[Confidence](/confidence) explains how `confidence` is derived from `probabilities` and how to use it to decide when to act automatically and when to escalate to a person.

## Reference specific fields

The content being evaluated, the [state](/concepts/state), is often a JSON object with several parts: a conversation, a record, a policy. When a question is about one of those parts, name it in the `instructions` with a dot-and-index path to its key, including the backticks. The model then knows which part of the state to judge.

Take the support conversation from the State page:

```json theme={null}
{
  "ticket": {
    "subject": "Duplicate charge",
    "messages": [
      {"from": "customer", "text": "I was charged twice for order A-104. Please refund the duplicate."},
      {"from": "support", "text": "We are checking the charges."}
    ]
  },
  "order": {
    "id": "A-104",
    "charges": [
      {"amount_usd": 49, "status": "captured"},
      {"amount_usd": 49, "status": "captured"}
    ]
  },
  "refund_policy": "Duplicate charges are eligible for a refund."
}
```

These two questions point at the customer's message, the policy, and the charges by path:

```python theme={null}
questions = {
    "refund_requested": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": "Does `ticket.messages[0].text` request a refund?",
    },
    "policy_supports_refund": {
        "type": "noul",
        "instructions": (
            "Does `refund_policy` support the refund requested "
            "in `ticket.messages[0].text`, given `order.charges`?"
        ),
    },
}
```

Explicit paths make it clear which parts of a structured state should inform each judgment. See [State](/concepts/state) for how to structure the input.

## Ask multiple questions together

Send every question that uses the same state in one request. You can mix question types freely. System One models evaluate every question in a request in parallel. Adding questions barely changes the response time and costs only the tokens for the extra questions, which are cheap. Asking a question you might not need is close to free.

This request classifies a customer message, checks for urgency, and scores frustration all at once:

<TypesafeExample
  example={{
state:
  "Our API integration started returning 500 errors on every request about 20 minutes ago, and we can't process any customer orders until this is fixed.",
questions: {
  department: {
    type: 'choice',
    instructions: 'Which team should handle this',
    criteria: {
      billing: 'Payment or subscription issues',
      technical: 'Bugs or integration problems',
      sales: 'Pricing or account questions',
    },
  },
  is_urgent: {
    type: 'noul',
    instructions: 'The message conveys urgency or time-sensitivity',
  },
  frustration: {
    type: 'score',
    instructions: 'How frustrated the customer appears',
    criteria: [
      'Calm, just stating facts',
      'Frustrated but civil',
      'Very angry, strong language',
    ],
  },
},
}}
/>

Our [client SDKs](/sdk) provide typed questions and answers. In Python, pass a `questions` dictionary of `Choice`, `Noul`, and `Score` objects to `client.system_one(...)`. This request sends a ticket and a refund policy once and gets a typed answer for each question:

```python theme={null}
from typesafe_sdk import Choice, Noul, Score, TypeSafeClient

state = {
    "ticket_message": "My flight was cancelled. Can I get a refund?",
    "refund_policy": "Cancelled flights are eligible for a full refund.",
}

with TypeSafeClient() as client:
    response = client.system_one(
        state=state,
        questions={
            "refund_requested": Noul(
                instructions="Does `ticket_message` request a refund?",
            ),
            "request_type": Choice(
                instructions="What is the main request in `ticket_message`?",
                criteria={
                    "refund": "The customer wants money returned.",
                    "rebooking": "The customer wants a replacement flight.",
                    "information": "The customer is asking for information only.",
                },
            ),
            "frustration": Score(
                instructions="How frustrated does the customer appear in `ticket_message`?",
                criteria=[
                    "Calm and neutral.",
                    "Concerned but civil.",
                    "Very angry or using strong language.",
                ],
            ),
        },
    )

print(response.answers["refund_requested"].noul)
print(response.answers["request_type"].choice)
print(response.answers["frustration"].score)
```

See [client SDKs](/sdk) for installation and usage in your language.

### Ask speculative questions

Ask every question your code might need, including ones whose answer only matters for some inputs, and let the code decide which answers to use. If a ticket turns out not to be a bug report, ignore the severity answer. We call this the [Speculative fan-out](/patterns/fan-out) pattern. The [Parallel questions cookbook](/cookbooks/parallel_questions) shows how batching 13 questions into one call is 11.5x cheaper and 9.6x faster than 13 separate calls, with no change in the answers.

The number of questions in one request is limited only by the request's token budget, which the state and the questions share. The budget is around 32,000 tokens, roughly 150,000 characters of English text.

<Tip>
  Coding agents fall into the one question per call habit more than people do. The [TypeSafe agent skill](/agent-skill#installation) tells your agent to put many questions in each call, including ones that only matter for some inputs.
</Tip>

### Split a complex judgment into several questions

A judgment that depends on several things is best split into one question per thing. Combine the answers in your code, giving each a weight for its relative importance. The weights are yours. When the combined result doesn't match what your team would decide, change them in code and run again. Adding questions barely changes the response time because they run in parallel within one request. The split costs a few extra question tokens.

For example, ticket priority might be built from three Score questions: how severe the bug is, how frustrated the customer is, and how much the report gives an engineer to work with. The Score page walks through this request and the code that normalizes and weights the answers in [Splitting a complex judgment into several Scores](/primitives/score#splitting-a-complex-judgment-into-several-scores). This technique is called the [Composite scoring](/patterns/composite-scoring) pattern.

### When one question depends on another

Questions in the same request are independent: one answer does not become context for another question. If a later judgment depends on an earlier answer, make a second request in code. The dependency is real only when your code cannot build the second request until it has the first answer: it needs the answer to fetch more data for the state, to decide what the state is made of, or to pick the next question's options. Otherwise, ask the questions together and combine their answers in code.

Two requests are the exception, not the rule. If the second request's questions could have been asked against the original state, ask them in the first request and let the code ignore the ones it doesn't need. Three cookbooks make a second request for a real reason. [Skill suggestion](/cookbooks/skill_suggestion) ranks 182 skills in one request, then fetches the full text of the top three and judges them again against that better evidence. [Structure recovery](/cookbooks/autoformat) asks whether each line break split a sentence, merges lines into blocks from those answers, then classifies the blocks, which did not exist until the first request had answered. [Hierarchical classification](/cookbooks/hierarchical_classification) uses each Choice answer to decide which options the next request offers.

See [How to build with TypeSafe](/concepts/how-to-build-with-system-one) for guidance on breaking a workflow into focused judgments.
